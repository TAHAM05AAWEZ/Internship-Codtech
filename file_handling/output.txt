This file has been created as part of my C programming internship assignment.
I’m learning how to perform basic file operations like creating a file, writing text to it, appending more data, and then reading it back. 
It's interesting to see how the data stays even after the program ends, which is different from variables that vanish after execution. 
This is my first time doing something like this using actual file pointers and modes in C, and it feels like a small step into real-world programming.
Now I’m adding this extra paragraph just to try out the append functionality. 
It should come right after the previous text without deleting anything. 
I think I’m getting the hang of how 'a' mode works in fopen(). 
This exercise really helped me understand why file handling is so important in programming beyond just printing things to the terminal.
